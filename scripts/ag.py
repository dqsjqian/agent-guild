"""ag — Agent Guild CLI (zero-dependency, stdlib only).

Bootstraps and maintains the shared cross-agent directory at ~/.agent-guild/.
Writes are atomic + audited so multiple agents can share state without
corrupting it. Reads stay plain file reads (zero cost).

Runs on Windows / macOS / Linux (and POSIX-ish mobile shells) with Python 3.8+.
No third-party packages.

Commands:
  init [agent]            Bootstrap ~/.agent-guild/ (idempotent, safe to re-run)
  find-root [agent]       Locate your user-extensible skills dir — instant,
                          never asks the user, READONLY fallback if not found
  link-root [agent]       Consolidate to ONE directory link <skills_root> ->
                          ~/.agent-guild/skills (replaces per-skill links,
                          DRY-RUN report by default)
  link-root --apply       Execute the consolidation: foreign links move into
                          the guild, guild links go to trash, real skills
                          abort with a pointer to `adopt --apply` first
  adopt [agent]           Scan agent home for adoptable assets (DRY-RUN report)
  adopt --apply [agent]   Move assets into the guild + link back
  bootstrap               Print all shared context (identity/rules/projects/focus)
  doctor                  Health check: broken links, stale paths, version drift
  platform                Identify THIS device: os / arch / host-id / link support
  tool <name>             Resolve a tool's executable for this platform (prints
                          the path; exit 3 + install hint when unavailable)
  tools                   List declared tools x availability on this device
  port                    Portability audit for multi-device guilds (DRY-RUN)
  port --apply            Move host-scoped state under hosts/<host-id>/,
                          fold registry paths per device, declare tool platforms
  upgrade                 Check 3 platforms for a newer skill version (dry-run)
  upgrade --apply         Download + install the latest version, keep user data
  status                  List registered agents + last_seen
  register <agent> <home> <tier> [skills_root] [caps...]
  last-seen <agent>       Refresh an agent's presence
  send <dst> <topic>      Write an inbox message from stdin
  log <agent> <title>     Append a daily log entry from stdin
  focus <agent> <title>   Update current-focus from stdin
  learn <agent> <kind> "<summary>"   Learning-ledger entry (details from stdin)
                          kind: learning | error | featreq
                          opts: --area A --priority P --category C --pattern-key K
  review                  Ledger stats: pending items + promotion candidates
  resolve <ID> [note ...] Mark a ledger entry resolved (+ resolution note)
  groom [--dry-run]       Data hygiene: archive expired logs/focus/ledgers,
                          rotate audit trail, report degradation (never deletes)
  audit [n]               Show last n audit lines (default 20)
  prune [days]            List agents idle > N days (default 30) — never deletes

Env:
  AGENT_GUILD_DIR   override central dir (default ~/.agent-guild)
  AG_AGENT          your agent name (used by `send`, and as default for
                    init/adopt when no agent argument is given)
  AG_HOST_ID        override this device's id (default <os>-<arch>-<hostname>)
  AG_PLATFORM       override platform detection as <os>-<arch> (e.g. linux-x64)

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 error, 2 usage.

# several devices (any folder-sync tool, cloud drive, or VCS checkout): a
# laptop, a desktop running another OS, a phone. Protocol 3.3 therefore gives
# every stored fact a SCOPE, so a second device can tell "not mine" apart from
# "missing":
#
#   shared    true on every device       -> stays exactly where it always was
#   platform  true for one OS+arch pair  -> declared per platform tag
#   host      true for this device only  -> namespaced under hosts/<host-id>/
#
# Rule of thumb for any agent: "would this still be true on another device?"
# Yes -> shared. Only on the same OS -> platform. Only here -> host.
#
# Link-direction invariant: the guild OWNS its payloads. Links pointing from
# the guild to an external path break on every other device, so they are a
# violation; links pointing INTO the guild (runtime skills dirs, project
# checkouts) are the normal, portable direction.
